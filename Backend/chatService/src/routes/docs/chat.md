### `router.post("/messages", isAuth, upload.single('image'), sendMessages)`:

- User sends a POST request to /messages (e.g., sending a text or image message in a chat app).

- isAuth middleware checks if the user is logged in.

- upload.single('image') looks for a file named "image" in the request and:

  ``` html 
    <input name="image" type="file">
 ``` 
-  It uploads the file to Cloudinary (as per your config).
- Uploads it to Cloudinary.

- Makes the URL available as req.file.path.

- sendMessages controller uses the req.body.text and optionally req.file.path to store the message in the database.
